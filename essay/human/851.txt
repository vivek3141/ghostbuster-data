Introduction to Blockchain
Blockchain is a technology for recording and storing information, first introduced by a person or a group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Initially, this technology was developed as a fundamentally new way of working with data that would not be subject to retroactive modification. This principle of operation was necessary to protect the data stored in blockchains. However, on the market, blockchain was presented as a system that allows you to work with cryptocurrencies â€“ the latest invention of digital money with a decentralized deposit guarantee system. This paper aims to discuss the blockchain decentralized system in terms of its potential to become a pathway to intellectual property globalization.
