Many countries are becoming more multicultural, and doctors are accepting patients from different socio-cultural backgrounds. Thus, there is an increasing need of intercultural communication between people. It is especially critical in the healthcare area since people discuss topics related to medicine, diseases, and even saving life. Effective doctor-patient interaction is associated with increased patient satisfaction, adherence to recommendations and outcomes, and improving health (Purnell, 2002). When the socio-cultural differences between patients and doctors are not studied and brought to practice, this can lead to patient dissatisfaction, non-compliance with recommendations, and harmful health consequences.
