The research paper highlights the importance and effectiveness of COVID vaccine boosters for people in general. To confirm this fact, attention was drawn to numerous studies of vaccines, their action, and the various manifestations and reactions of both single-component vaccines and doses requiring amplification. A source supporting the idea was found in one of the world’s most respected general scientific journals. The article “Mixing COVID vaccines triggers potent immune response” by Ewen Callaway, published in the journal Nature , devoted to research mainly on natural sciences, was selected. The source could be sponsored by an editor interested in gaining prestige as a result of the publication. The article evaluated can be considered successful in terms of the necessary characteristics, including reliability, usefulness, relevance, and meaningfulness based on facts.
