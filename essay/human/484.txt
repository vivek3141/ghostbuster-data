The video “Play is more than just fun” features a bio-psycho-social-spiritual issue of play and its importance in people’s life. The concept of play is regarded as a developmental issue, connecting a person’s body to his brain through some links. The play is considered a significant part of people’s lives since it allows individuals to hone their skills, manual and mental (Brown, 2008). Moreover, through play, a person’s values may be developed. Group play allows developing such qualities as loyalty to one’s group, codependence, and the spirit of competition. The game fosters connections within the brain at a subconscious level and helps people relax and be themselves.
The issue of importance in my life is whether one can improve one’s memory through a game. Nowadays, when I am a student, I have to memorize a lot of information, and I have found that traditional methods of purposeful memorizing are not always effective. I believe that since games act subconsciously, there is a good chance to improve one’s memory if one can find the right kind of games. Moreover, playing games helps to relax; and relaxing while memorizing something useful could be a very good and beneficial activity.
I would like to explore further how play fosters innovation and what mechanisms are responsible for this connection. Being the driving force of progress, innovative thinking is applicable in all spheres of life; however, it is not easy to think of a feasible idea that would change people’s lives for the better. The connection between games and creativity, if proved, could pioneer a new way of thinking when new ideas come to mind subconsciously through an activity that people enjoy.
My question for the class discussion is why the opposite of play is depression and what psychological mechanisms could be responsible for this connection.
