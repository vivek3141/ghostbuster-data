According to the discussion, the existence of medieval culture was in a decade filled with plague, famine, social turmoil, and unprecedented desire for social mobility. I agree with the ideas as the crucial turning point of this substantive impact was the Black Death, which highly interfered with the social-economic of the people (Tuchman 230). Before the plague, life for the peasants was intact and medical technology and practices were improving during this particular period. The church was also a prevalent force as it rapidly evolved in this century. The majority of the population could comprehend the sermon as the preaching was presented in vernacular. Moreover, in that century, most individuals were illiterate and it was challenging to possess books as they were expensive. Women were expected to be submissive as they depended on their husbandsâ€™ courtship. Children were raised on high moral standards as society induced certain principles to be followed.
