The film that was watched in order to note a number of cases of violence or abuse is For colored girls . The type of abuse that will be taken from the movie refers to rape. In particular, it is the situation around Tangie, who was raped by her grandfather (Perry, 2010). Below, the assessments, implementation, and education within the scope of a care plan will be provided.
Initially, it will be essential to evaluate Tangieâ€™s mental state, which can be done after a series of conversations. The latter ones should be conducted with Tangie and her closest people who can shed light on the situation. It is expected that the ones involved will share several details on how the mentioned type of abuse took place, as well as what Tangie is likely to feel now.
After this information is obtained, the care plan is to be developed and implemented. The first stage will imply regular conversations with Tangie that will cover the themes of her feelings and view of the tragedy. Then, it will be important to enroll her in a group of those who have been raped that she will attend on a weekly basis. Tangie should feel support around her so that she could abandon the sense of loneliness. This might diminish the possibility of constant depression and avert some severe mental traumas.
Throughout the whole care plan, it will also be crucial to educate Tangie on how to deal with the stress resulting from the rape. During the mentioned plan, she will be provided with the recognized literature in the field. The most important points will be discussed with me and in the group. It seems critical to surround her with an environment in which people will hear and listen to her.
