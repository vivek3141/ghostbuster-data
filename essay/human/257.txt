Feedback is usually a review or statement of opinion about the service provided or the work done. This type of communication is common both in relations between an employee and a client, and an employee and an employer. The importance of such a tool is due to the fact that it contributes to the timely adjustment of the employeeâ€™s actions so that he best achieves the goal. In addition, with the help of feedback, you can confirm the correctness of the actions of the individual. It is important to note that there are both positive and negative types of such a relationship, which differ in their goals. So, if a positive review is intended to encourage the process performed by an employee, then a negative one is used to change the vector of work. An example would be when a worker receives a message that a task was completed successfully, they can move on to the next step.
Here you can clearly see that the employee is going in the right direction, which means the feedback is positive. If it happens that the review indicates the need to redo the work, since errors or shortcomings are exposed, then such a review is treated as negative (Primeast US, 2016). It is necessary to choose the right way to leave a review, namely, to observe the correct subordination form, business tone, not to switch to insults or jokes. This will allow both criticism and praise to be constructive so that it can be handled without putting the worker out of action. It is also worth receiving feedback in a balanced, calm and not tired state in order to control reactions and emotions. An employee, as a rule, does not know in advance what kind of feedback they sent him, and in order not to break loose, it is necessary to be ready for anything. In addition, it is often appropriate to practice remote feedback to avoid interpersonal conflicts. This is done through corporate mail or special sites for leaving reviews.
