“Young Goodman Brown” was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1835, but it was set in Puritan New England during the late 17th century. The Puritans split from England’s Anglican Church, arriving at Plymouth Rock and founding both Plymouth and Boston. They became the main Christian sect in New England at the period, though other Christian groups such as Quakers and Anabaptists also had significant populations. Puritans believed in a rigid philosophy that left no space for mistake; for example, immoral thoughts and dreams were seen to be as damaging as actually committing a sin. Native Americans who did not follow Christianity were likewise thought to be Satan’s children, according to them. “Young Goodman Brown” is set during the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and exposes the Salem Puritans’ hypocritical and inhibitive moral ideals.
