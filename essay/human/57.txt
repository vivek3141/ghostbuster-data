The dance originated from a variety of movements and gestures associated with the processes of activity and emotional impressions of a person from the world around him. The movements were gradually subjected to artistic generalization. As a result, the art of dance was formed, one of the oldest manifestations of folk art. Anna Pavlova is one of those who brought the art of ballet to the United States. Initially associated with the word and song, the dance gradually acquired an independent meaning. Cultural representatives such as Anna Pavlova are cult figures and have influenced the development of the dance scene in the United States.
Dance has always occupied and will occupy a huge space in the life and everyday culture of mankind. Anna Pavlova traveled across America, bringing her dance and ballet culture, surprising and delighting the audience. She presented unconventional dance styles and forms for the 1900s. She performed at such well-known venues as Broadway, where many viewers could meet and be inspired by a new direction for themselves (Soren, 2017). Therefore, Anna Pavlova spread a new approach to twentieth-century ballet shows. Such participation in the culture becomes memorable and affects the perception of many dancers and ordinary spectators.
