Based on the stipulated fact regarding the story behind numbers, I opine that several financial drivers are behind the story. Firstly, the price change percentage plays a key role as a financial indicator. It implies how prices adjust on a declining basis, inclining basis or a discounted basis. This indicator is instrumental because one cannot maintain sales at the same price. Such attributes are associated with various external factors that act with forces of demand and supply.
Secondly, the cost of a good percentage is another vital financial indicator whose influence cannot be ignored. The impact is due to the factors associated with cost (Mack, 2021). For instance, the cost is a vital determinant of price; therefore it is mandatory to do cost consideration for the price alteration. Finally, account receivable marks are a critical indicator in every organization. It implies the returns from sales recorded since the success of every organization relies majorly on the positivity of numbers in account receivable, which has crucial importance associated with the same (Hristov & Chirico, 2019). Talking about a story behind a number, these three indicators go hand in hand with the success of the actual story. Keeping an eye on these indicators calls for intensive insight and analysis of the same. Such consideration will be instrumental in decisional stages and subsequent improvement, enhancing profitable financial decisions.
