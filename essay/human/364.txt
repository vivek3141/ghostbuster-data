Introduction
One of Edward Said’s core concepts in orientalism is that knowledge about the East is formed via imagined constructions rather than objective facts. Said’s definition of orientalism envisions Western superiority over Eastern cultures (Said 1981). Said observes that the global perception of the Islam community is significantly influenced by the newspapers, mainly from the United States, that have orientalist representations (Said 1981). This research paper investigates if Said’s claim that orientalism is dominating the Newspaper media is valid or not. The conclusion responds to the question; Was Said’s claim that orientalism dominates the media valid? The newspapers’ entities may be using orientalism as a product to sell to the public.
