Chemerinsky, Erwin, and Michele Goodwin. “Constitutional Gerrymandering against Abortion Rights: Nifla V. Becerra.” New York University Law Review , vol. 94, no. 1, 2019, pp. 1-124.
This article, published by two professors of law, discusses abortion rights as they pertain to informing women about contraception and abortion. The article’s main point, illustrated by recent cases, is that the conservative Supreme Court will likely continue to infringe upon abortion rights using very broad interpretations of the Constitution. It may be useful in the paper because the authors quote important statistics regarding abortion to support their point. The source’s strength is in using statistical data to reinforce its point, but the author’s clear bias in favor of abortion rights may be considered a weakness.
Erdman, Joann an. “Theorizing Time in Abortion Law and Human Rights.” Health and Human Rights Journal , vol. 19, no. 1, 2017, pp. 29-40.
This article by a specialist in health law and policy discusses the issue of abortion from health and justice perspectives. The author argues that specific terms for allowing or forbidding abortion are largely arbitrary, and the main concern should be caring for the health and rights of women rather than imposing any rigid standard. The article analyzes numerous examples of legal temporal restrictions to stringy support its point, but its weakness is that it does not advise on specific ways of addressing pregnant women’s rights and health. It would be best used to provide information on how abortion laws view health risks.

This article by two researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, a leading abortion advocacy organization, covers the rates of abortion in the United States. The authors’ method was cross-referencing several databases, and their conclusion is that there is an evident but not uniform decline in abortion rates. The wealth of statistical information is the source’s main strength and also the best way to use it in the paper. Its main weakness is rhetorical because the authors’ affiliation indicates a bias in favor of abortion.
Rebouche, Rachel. “Abortion Rights as Human Rights.” Social & Legal Studies , vol. 25, no. 6, 2016, pp. 765-782.
This article by a lawyer from Temple University argues that a human rights perspective may minimize the legal challenges of implementing abortion rights. It supports this main point by discussing how the increasing prominence of the human rights perspective weakens institutional barriers against abortion rights. It would be best used to illustrate the argument in favor of abortion rights based on the [regnant women’s right to health, which is its major strength.
Thomson, Judith J. “A Defense of Abortion.” University of Colorado , Web.
This article, written by a prominent feminist thinker for everybody interested in the subject, debunks philosophical arguments against abortion. By using robust thought experiments, which constitute its major strength, the article proves that arguments against abortion based on the fetus’s right to live do not stand up to criticism. It is best used according to its strengths to illustrate mainstream logical arguments for and against abortion, and its only weakness is that it is relatively old, but its logic does not really age.
