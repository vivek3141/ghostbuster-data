Introduction
People of various cultures have different perceptions toward various elements of the outer world. They are based on a culture’s value system, which defines how its members react to the environment: for example, whether to adapt to it or try to control it. A prominent example is the relationships with nature: Western civilization and minor Native American civilizations have different views on nature, traditions, and their societies in general. Understanding those discrepancies between cultures and establishing good contact may help greatly in improving the well-being of small cultures’ representatives and preserving nature.
Case Study Description: Lummi People
Lummi people are the Native American tribe living in Washington state. They suffer from massive timber production, which has continued since the 19th century (Russo, 2011). Those lands were full of old woods, sacred for the Lummi people; thus, their cutting was destructive for the tribe. During the 20th century, most of those woods were totally destroyed, which led to the almost total extinction of the tribe. Today, tribe representatives and American government
organizations, such as the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, seek contact to preserve both the remaining forests and the tribe.
