One of the key aspects of the assessment includes risk analysis and goal setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process. The video provides an insightful demonstration of how risk assessment and goal setting are conducted when dealing with a client.
The assessment session begins with the risk assessment process, where a counselor asks a client whether or not he or she has suicidal thoughts. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the counselor asks the client to report if she will start having such inclinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A similar structure is applied to tendencies of harming others with an equivalent request to report. The last part of the risk assessment includes questions about drug-related issues, such as hallucinations (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The goal setting process is initiated by questions regarding goals on the client’s life in general, for which she responds with “nice cushy job” and “better future for her children” (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A more specific goal also needs to be identified, such as becoming drug free. The third part of goal setting involves objectives specifically for counseling itself, such as being less angry, sleeping more, eating less, and trying to quit drugs (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). The confidence in achieving is also assessed, which can range from no confidence to full confidence. The very last part is about questions for the counselor and structure informing.
In conclusion, the core elements of risk assessment include the questioning of risk factors, such as self-harm, harm to others, and drug-related issues. In contrast, goal setting involves general objectives, specific overall goals, and goals specific for the counseling.
