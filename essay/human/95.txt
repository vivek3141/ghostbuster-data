World history is an endless treasure trove of valuable lessons for modern humanity. People of all ages have round-the-clock access to various educational materials to research all kinds of historical events, phenomena, and personalities. One such material is the video “BBC Ancient Greece: The Greatest Show on Earth – Democrats – 1/3” (Maximus, 2013). The presenter of this video talks about the importance of theater culture to the people of ancient Athens. At the beginning of the video, the host says that we must understand the ancient Greeks to understand ourselves. This phrase has profound meaning and sets the tone for the rest of the story. By this, the presenter implies that history is cyclical and that many of our problems are like those of people who lived many hundreds of years ago. Indeed, like fashion, history has a way of repeating itself. That is why looking at the life of the ancient Greeks; many modern people will be able to find their reflection in them.
The film’s overall meaning is that the meaning of theater then and now is strikingly different. Today, theatrical productions are seen by people as entertainment and recreation. In the days of the ancient Greeks, the people of Athens learned the latest news from theatrical productions. Athens made the theater the center of its democracy – it was through performances on the stage residents participated in the city’s political life (Maximus, 2013). For the Athenians, the theater was not just a mirror of their present; it was itself a stage on which that present could be played out. The story of Athens is a story of survival in a complex and changing world. The video tells the dramatic story from the creation of the theater and shows how Athenian tragedy and comedy not only reflected the subtleties of that survival but were critical reasons for it.
Based on the above, this week’s history teaches us that ancient events can be much closer than they appear. Like the people of Athens, we, too, follow the news from the productions-political debates press conferences. Our democratic will manifests itself in observation, as it did many years ago. In this way, history works out its cyclical and repetitive nature, forcing us to reflect on our place in the broader socio-political arena.
