A person’s life is impossible without communication with other people. The need to convey one’s thoughts and experiences gave rise to oral, then written speech. To clearly and logically share one’s thoughts with the interlocutor, it is necessary to know the basic rules of speech culture. A person speaking publicly should talk beautifully, build phrases correctly, and establish contact with the audience. Reading from a sheet is always perceived superficially, which is why the speaker must skillfully use both verbal and non-verbal means of language. This work is devoted to body language during the speeches of Martin Luther King “I Have a Dream” and Alicia Garza from the movement “Black Lives Matter.” Both speakers are charismatic and can win the audience’s attention due to their high command of body language.
In his public speech, King called for civil and economic rights and an end to racism in the United States. In addition, he spoke about equality and fraternity among people of all colors and nationalities. King’s speech contained aspects describing the need for jobs and freedom for the black population (Rare Facts, 2018). In her speech dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement, Garza also speaks about the importance of equality and tolerance towards the black population (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). She argues that racism and racial prejudice have no place in modern civilized society and calls on the audience to fight against any manifestations of racism.
These speeches have certain similarities and differences, which are first expressed in the manner of the speaker. The similarities of the speeches lie in the common theme they are dedicated to the fight against racism and inequality towards black people. Both speakers talk about unfair treatment, bias, and the need for tolerance since all people were created equal. King and Garza actively use the optical-kinetic sign system, including gestures and facial expressions (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). In addition, both speakers know the techniques of paralinguistics and extralinguistics, that is, the range and tonality of the voice and the inclusion of pauses in speech. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to notice differences in the approach to the performance of King and Garza.
King’s voice seems much more staged and saturated with intonations; it flows slowly and then accelerates, becoming more exciting and passionate. During King’s speech, it is difficult to tear eyes away from him and distract oneself with something else since his voice and somewhat imperious manner of speech completely capture and do not let go until the end (Rare Facts, 2018). Garza’s performance seems calmer, and her intonations are balanced, as if she is not trying to convince the audience of her point of view but only stating facts (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). In addition, King’s speech is full of metaphors and vivid images and repetitions of the exact phrase, which is also the name of the address itself. All this creates a unique imprint and allows the speaker’s performance to occupy the audience’s thoughts for a long time.
It can also be added that the place where the speech was delivered plays a significant role in influencing the audience. King’s speech was delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, which adds to its significance and the necessary atmosphere since this place is one of the most important for Americans (Rare Facts, 2018). Garza’s speech, on the other hand, cannot boast of a particular place of utterance, and therefore does not remain so much in memory, being only one of many speeches on this platform (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Finally, the audience, which is present during the speech, is essential. For the most part, King’s audience, consisting of ordinary black workers, understood well what he was talking about and therefore supported him. Garza’s audience is also well aware of the issues raised in the speech, thereby giving more weight to the speaker’s speech.
