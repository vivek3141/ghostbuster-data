Fashion and clothing are constituents of a framework that fosters social equality under the spectrum of individualism. Lushch (2018) addresses the complex approach and phenomenon through an overview of the changes. The author argues that “there is a dualism across each individual expressed through creativity and any shortcoming renders the dissatisfaction about life” (Lushch, 2018). The primary objective of style entails incorporating a dynamic and distinctive innovation between the various social classes. The researcher stipulates that although it is important to utilize creativity, it is a phenomenon that renders the optimal marginalization of personnel from varying segments associated with financial endowments (Lushch, 2018). Trends in clothing and design foster the ultimate platform for identity with the vast community while determining the eloquence in taste. Therefore, it is a ritual that separates the diverse societies based on the subjective perception of wealthiness.
The key sociological pairs in fashion enshrine imitation and distinction through the spectral insight of diversity. In this case, Whyte (2018) postulates that the replication is a demonstration of cheap products due to establishing the setting and expected quality within the marketplace. Therefore, it is crucial to address the major issue underlying the impact of simulations on society to foster unity. On the one hand, it is an initiative that renders the association across the global community. On the other hand, it is an illusion that draws the margin between the dynamic classes within a region. Whyte (2018) provides a profound discernment based on the paramount aspect of eradicating mimicry and enhancing authenticity for alliances and actualization.
The other part of the sociological pair in fashion is the distinction based on the importance of enhancing authenticity and creativity. According to Whyte (2018), the optimal value in designing and style encompasses the relevance of creating a new trend for the elite social class that supersedes the previous layers. Therefore, the difference depends on the developers’ level of innovation, hence cultivating the margin across the demographic population. There is an interplay between diversity and imitation due to the impact on the quality of life and the determination of the social identity. The optimal approach that elevates the union across the global community is the establishment of common variables in vogue.
Dualism emerges from the interplay of the sociological pair due to the concept of heredity and variation. Whyte (2018) indicates that the conflict between socialism and individualism establishes the essence of engaging the individuals in the constantly changing society. It is vital to determine the core framework of ensuring optimal exploitation of solutions during evolution to harmonize the variety. The marginal outliers of balance and performance in engagements identify the biformity. In this case, people engage in various relations based on integrating the ambivalence with the appropriate features in the fashion industry.
