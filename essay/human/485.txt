Most of the patients in need of incubation tend to portray ventilation alterations. For this reason, they tend to experience bronchial secretion, which can complicate their evolution if not adequately controlled. Associated complications can lead to mucus plugs, atelectasis, and at times, super-infection, which favor the onset of nosocomial pneumonia. Research has not specified how the practice needs to be performed on adults living with endotracheal intubation. However, the institutionâ€™s protocols need to be followed and justify that the patients require aspirations depending on the secretion visualizations in the airways. Coughing attempts, agitation, shortness of breath, snoring, and anxiety is respiratory indicators of impairment. In this regard, patients need to be interrogated on whether they think aspiration is essential.
The scenario demonstrates a lack of proper guidelines on proper treatment intervention for pneumonia patients. For this reason, an appropriate treatment plan needs to be enacted and communicated to all nursing practitioners. To show the effect of saline installation and lack of it on the pneumonia risk, the following step by step plan is necessary:
