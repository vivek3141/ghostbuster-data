Directional strategies are the essential aspects or approaches that guide strategists make critical organizational decisions. The primary directional strategies include vision, mission, goals, and values. Vision statement creates a mental image of the organization to the society and the entire public. On the other hand, the mission statement highlights the organization’s distinctive reason or purpose for existing in a given environment and distinguishes it from others of its type. The organization’s scope of operations in goods, services, and the market is identified from the mission statement. Strategic goals are the results or benchmarks associated with success factors (Ginter et al., 2018). Lastly, the organization’s core values are the fundamental guiding principles that shape its culture amongst its members and stakeholders. On the contrary, strategic alternatives are the intellectual curiosity of gathering, organizing, and analyzing information accompanied by the willingness to be and remain open to creative thoughts, ideas, and solutions that last in the long term.
