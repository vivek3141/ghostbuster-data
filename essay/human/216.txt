As a matter of fact, one of the most comprehensive definitions of marketing was given by the American Marketing Association (AMA). According to it, marketing is “the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large” (AMA, n.d., para. 2). Although all components of the marketing form consumers’ demands, they are also affected by their free choice.
