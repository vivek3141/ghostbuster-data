The article primarily focuses on improving the overall understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on Saudi Arabia’s students. The authors aim to highlight the critical intricacies of anxiety and the latter’s relationship with the pandemic, where the primary data collection method was online questionnaires. The research utilizes Zung’s self-rating anxiety questionnaire, which provides a wide range of anxiety indexes that can be further studied on the correlational relationship in regard to gender, age, and year of study. The article is highly useful to the selected topic of research since it provides valuable insight into how the pandemic affects university students without viral infection. The study’s core limitation is that measurements are done only in one university, meaning that the data might not reflect other educational institutions.
The COVID-19 pandemic was a catastrophic experience not only due to the virus itself but also its indirect impacts, such as the increase in overall anxiety and stress among the population of the nation. The article will not be the core basis of my research, but it will be utilized as an essential source of information and evidence for anxiety-related data.
