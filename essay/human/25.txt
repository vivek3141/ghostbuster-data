The rhythmic accounting rap song Debit Credit Theory by Colin Dodds (n.d.) is an excellent way to remember that debit’s location is the left side of the account, and credit’s location is the right one. This unusual song also explains the meaning of these two terms. This fun but an educational source has enabled me to remember the material and not get confused in the concepts.

The mnemonic offered by Heather McNellis (2020) also contributes to better understanding and remembering the essence of debit and credit and the account balances. The DEAL/CLIP mnemonic contains the explanation of debit’s and credit’s parts. Due to this engaging technic, it is pretty easy to understand that while debit includes Drawings, Expenses, Assets, and Losses, credit consists of Capital, Liabilities, Income, as well as Profits.

I have chosen these two sources since they make it easy to remember accounting basics. They are pretty bright, fun, and engaging: due to the song chorus, it is impossible to forget where debit and credit are located, and mnemonics help remember all their constituents. I think other students will also like them since they are suitable for people with different types of information perception.
