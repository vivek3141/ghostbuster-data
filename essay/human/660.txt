I have chosen these internships because they are all designed for a medical assistant. This profession is in demand in various fields of medical services. Each of the programs has different specifics of the main specialties of the paramedic. However, all of these subspecies of medical assistant activity are interesting to me. From the first internship, I want to get a medical unit practice at a large medical organization. For the second internship, I want to strengthen my examination skills. In the third internship, my goal is the practice establishing diagnoses. The fourth internship will allow me to conduct independent treatment. The benefit of the fifth internship for me will be that I will be able to learn how to work closely with a doctor.
I plan to apply for the first internship because it will satisfy my need in obtaining the missing knowledge. Applying for the second internship will allow me to obtain the skills that a medical assistant needs. I plan to apply for the third internship because this way I will be able to practically acquire the necessary manual skills. Applying for the fourth internship will allow me to master the officially approved standards of assistance volumes.
