Most of the communities or groups of people have their own identifying cultural background. Their setup of the society majorly influences the behaviors, attitudes, morals, ethics of a person. The term culture has several different meanings and attributes associated with it depending on the geographical location or the society (Mironenko and Sorokin, 2018, p. 339). According to Geert Hofstede, culture is “the programming of the human mind by which one group of people distinguishes itself from other groups” (Taras, 2017, p. 2). The paper will compare and contrast the cultures of Saudi Arabia and Australia based on the masculinity versus femininity and uncertainty avoidance dimensions of Hofstede’s cultural framework.
