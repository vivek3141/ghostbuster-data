Topgolf is a high-growth platform with favorable unit economics across its companies. It will benefit from Callaway’s solid financial position, which allows it to fully support Topgolf’s expansion ambitions at a low cost of capital. Both businesses are focused on golf and active-lifestyle customers. The acquired company will benefit from a compelling family of brands with reach across numerous channels, including retail, venues, e-commerce, and digital communities, thanks to Topgolf’s 90 million consumer contact points every year. Callaway’s golf equipment and soft products companies benefit from Topgolf’s efforts to introduce new players to the game of golf (Repar, 2021). The merged company’s industry-leading sales, marketing, and partnership infrastructure will enhance traffic, same-venue revenues, and new business conversion. The combined consumer reach of Callaway and Topgolf will result in enhanced promotion, exposure, and sales of equipment and clothing to golfers and non-golfers alike (Repar, 2021). A common innovation culture opens attractive long-term options, such as the ability to transmit information for teaching, exercise, and lifestyle across linked displays.
