Circumstances and Encountered Issues
In the case study presented, the overall setting surrounding the Asian Health Services (AHS) corporation appears to put additional pressure on the enterpriseâ€™s executives. AHS is a prosperous organization that was able to process over 117,000 patient visits in 2014 and possessed seven sites in addition to three owned properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). However, with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the situation changed drastically, creating both advantages and disadvantages for AHS. Although ACA increased patient supply, the medical organization encountered a significant challenge when introducing the new uninsured clients into the system and beginning their treatment (Chung & Chin, 2015). Furthermore, under the introduced act, the quality of care had to be improved tremendously, and the pay for performance framework had to be implemented (Chung & Chin, 2015). In the long term, these challenges were overcome by establishing an electronic medical records system, focusing on patient support, and adding new services.
Nonetheless, several issues remained to be addressed despite the successful changes. Currently, the organization needs to enhance its efforts in providing better care for its employees. As such, the customer services department requires more multilingual staff for efficient communication, while the chief medical officer argues that physicians and other providers need additional incentives (Chung & Chin, 2015). The medical and dental clinics were also suggested for expansion, given the increased numbers of patients (Chung & Chin, 2015). Therefore, crucial decisions are to be made if AHS is to improve its current outputs and resolve the emerging complications.
